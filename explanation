A small project of an app idea. Used agile artifacts to organize our team. Switched roles with each other. The whole project was done in greek, unfortunately.
We had to propose an idea that would make life easier in Pireus according to Unesco goals. We came up with a parking app since parking is hard to do in this part of the city.
